# Optimal_Flight_Routes

This program efficiently finds the shortest path between two aiports given user-inputted constraints (price, number of layovers, dates, seating preferenes, etc.). It uses MongoDB to store all the airports and flights, avoiding the redundant work of rereading files. It supports both CSV file reading to quickly insert multiple airports quickly. A user can also create and delete their own airports or flights, allowing easy manipulation of the database.
